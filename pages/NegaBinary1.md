So you've learned how to write numbers in [base 2 (binary) ](http://gdaymath.com/lessons/explodingdots/1-2-1-leftarrow-2-machine/), and you know how to write numbers in [base 3](http://gdaymath.com/lessons/explodingdots/2-3-explaining-machines/) as well as the usual way in [base 10](http://gdaymath.com/lessons/explodingdots/1-4-1-leftarrow-10-machine/).  Here's another cool way to write down numbers.  It's called [**negative binary**](::negbin/tooltip,transparent) and we can write all of the integers with it, both negative and positive, using only the symbols `0` and `1`.  Here's the catch.  We aren't going to use any negative signs, `-`, in front of a number to say that it's negative.  Here's a video from Goldfish and Robin that will show you how to get started.

**Negative Binary** represents numbers in base -2. Both positive and negative numbers are represented with the symbols `0` and `1` without the use of a minus sign `-`.
