##### Strings are Numbers
One of the most powerful ideas that people learn from James Tanton's [Exploding Dots](http://gdaymath.com/courses/exploding-dots/) (beginning number theory) is that there are many, many ways to write down numbers and do arithmetic.  When we are no longer stuck in base 10, the world of numbers opens up and strange things start to happen.  All kinds of text, writing and data can be interpreted as numbers.  In this exploration we'll see how Kurt GÃ¶del used this idea in his famous Incompleteness Theorem.
