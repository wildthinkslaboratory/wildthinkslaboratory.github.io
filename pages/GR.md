# Goldfish and Robin Videos on Exploding Dots
Here are all 23 of Goldfish and Robin's exploding dots videos.  You can see all their Spanish language videos [here](/pages/SpanishGR).

## Introducing the 1 $\leftarrow$ 2 Machine
The Goldfish and Robin crew introduce the base 2 machine.  Checkout the giant machine with people dots!

## Explaining the 1 $\leftarrow$ 2 Machine
Goldfish and Robin delve deeper into the base 2 machine and show how to translate base 2 numbers back to base 10.  Also, there's a great commercial for base 2 birthday candles at the end.  Also, cute spotted California ground squirrels.

## Explaining the 1 $\leftarrow$ 3 Machine
Goldfish, Aliyah and Vanilla the rabbit explain how to work backwards in a base 3 machine to translate base 3 numbers back into base 10 numbers.  Also, random bunny time and ukelele playing.

## Exploding Dots Addition
Goldfish and Robin explain how to do addition in any base and compare the exploding dots way of doing addition to the standard base 10 algorithm we learn in school.  There are also bunny cameos and Shadow bunny eating strawberry exploding dots.  Wait for it.  It's at the end.

## Antidots
What are antidots?  You need them for subtraction.

## Subtraction

Goldfish and Robin show how to do exploding dots subtraction.  It's more fun if you can eat the dots when they annihilate.

## Does Order Matter?
This is the first of two videos exploring whether the order of explosions affects the code that is generated in a base 2 machine.  Goldfish and Robin are joined by James Tanton to try and puzzle it out.  They do lots of thinking and eat lots of bananas and make good progress on the problem.

## Does Order Matter (Part 2)
Goldfish and Robin try to finish up their thinking on whether the order of explosions matters.  They draw the explosions as they happen creating a trace.  This way they can compare and reason about the different choices for order.  Also Goldfish makes a stop motion animation of the explosions that took a really long time to make.

## Exploding Dots Multiplication in a $1 \leftarrow 2$ Machine
Goldfish explains his way of doing multiplication in a base 2 machine.  Cameo from Vanilla (the rabbit).

## Exploding Dots Multiplication in a $1 \leftarrow 3$ Machine
Goldfish explains his way of doing multiplication in a base 3 machine.  Cameo from Shadow (the rabbit).

## Goldfish gets Creative with the Distributive Property

Exploding dots makes it easier for people to be creative and come up with their own strategies for doing arithmetic.  In this video, Goldfish talks about the distributive property and how he uses it to find easy and creative ways to multiply multi digit numbers.

## Division and Multiplication are Inverses
Goldfish and Robin show how multiplication and division are inverses, exploding dots style.  Also, check out the player piano in the outro.

## Polynomial Division Part 1
Polynomial division is sort of a drag when you learn it in Algebra 2 class.  Exploding dots makes polynomial division much more fun.  Levi and Robin show us how it's done.  Plus I love the original music composition by [Eric Merchant](https://math.uoregon.edu/profile/ericm).

## Base $2 \leftarrow 3$ Machine
You've seen all kinds of base machines now, but have you seen a base $\frac{3}{2}$ machine?  Check out this weird machine.  What does it mean?

## Inifinite Sums
Dani explains why the expression $\frac{1}{1-x}$ generates the infinite 
sum $$1 + x + x^2 + x^3 \cdots$$

## Negative Binary (or Base -2)
Imagine a number system with only two symbols `0` and `1` that could express both negative and positive numbers.  No negative signs required.

## Make Your Own Number System
There are so many different ways to count and do arithmetic.  Why not make your own!  A double decker peanutbutter and jelly sandwich might represent the number $97$.

## Make a 2D Machine
Who says a number system has to be a linear series of symbols?  How about a two dimensional number system for arithmetic.

## Dividing in Base $\frac{3}{2}$: A Question from James Propp
Goldfish and Robin's two dimensional number system turns out to be helpful when doing division in base $\frac32$.  Goldfish made this video in response to a question from mathematician [James Propp](https://www.uml.edu/sciences/mathematics/faculty/propp-james.aspx).
