#### Make a Better Number System

Our current system for writing numbers in base $10$ with the alphabet `{0123456789}`, evolved over a long period of time.  It's been used for so long in so many cultures that most people don't know any other way to count and do mathematics.  That doesn't mean it's the best system.  I personally think we could devise a better one.  Base $12$ is an intriguing possibility.  It has four divisors: $2,3,4$ and $6$.  The number $10$ only has two: $2$ and $5$.  Think back to when you learned the multiplication tables.  How might that process be different if the base had more divisors?  What if we had an alphabet where the symbols actually looked like the quantities they described?  What are the advantages and disadvantages to having a small base versus a larger base?  I hope you'll experiment.  If you come up with any great new system please let me know and I will add it to my page.
