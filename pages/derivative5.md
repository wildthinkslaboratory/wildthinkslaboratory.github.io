#### Some Final Thoughts

One of the major tasks of your first calculus class will be learning how to solve the limits that arise from the definiton of the derivative.
$$f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$$ 
There are many tricks to learn for different types of functions.  Usually, once we get all the tricks memorized we can take derivatives of functions quickly and easily. We hardly ever use the actual definition of the derivative again.   As a result, it's easy to forget where the tricks came from and why they work.  You can always come back here to refresh your memory!
