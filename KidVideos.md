## Kids Explain Math for Other Kids

Two kids founded a YouTube channel called [Goldfish and Robin](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCciX2VHmW7Ix_FVWQ_u4RwQ) to make educational videos.  Their goal is to create a community of kid creators where kids can share their knowledge and everyone learns from each other.  Here's their mission statement.

At Goldfish and Robin kids work on all parts of making videos.  They plan content, direct, work behind the camera, edit, animate, write music and of course teach in front of the camera.  Here are just a few highlights from their channel.  Check out their full [channel page](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCciX2VHmW7Ix_FVWQ_u4RwQ) for more.

If you are a kid who has made a great educational video let us know.  We'd love to highlight it at Goldfish and Robin.  Just make sure all kids in your video who are under 18 years old have a signed permission/release from their parents.   If you want to start your own kid video group [here](https://wildthinksblog.wordpress.com) are some ideas to get you started.
